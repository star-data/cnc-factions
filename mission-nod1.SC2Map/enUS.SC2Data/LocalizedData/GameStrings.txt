Param/Value/897A0509=Tiberium is a highly valuable and dangerous extraterrestrial resource that has reshaped the course of global warfare. Each unit of harvested Tiberium yields 10 minerals instead of the usual 5. Tiberium crystals can grow to sizes of up to 40 units, and Tiberium fields slowly regenerate over time. While immensely profitable, Tiberium is lethal to unprotected infantry, making its extraction as hazardous as it is rewarding. Tiberium crystal chunks can be destroyed by heavy weapons.
Param/Value/8FAAFCFC=Walking into Riksville
Param/Value/93EE42D2=The Emissary can locate viable base sites and deploy in order to expand the area in which buildings can be constructed. It is most useful when place near Tiberium fields. It is the only Nod vehicle that is built from the Construction Yard.

Param/Value/B7AF751E=Built on a gas spring and used to automatically harvest high-energy Vespene gas. Requires a nearby Tiberium Refinery to operate. To access distant Vespene geysers, you may need to unpack an MCV and construct a Refinery or Outpost near the geyser to expand the construction area, allowing Tiberium Silos to be built in remote locations.
Param/Value/B9FD3BB4=Core infantry of the Brotherhood.<n/>Lightly equipped, expendable, and easily replaced.<n/>Trains in squads of 4.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground units. </c>

Param/Value/E5CD398F=Raynor
Param/Value/E9F33511=Marine
Param/Value/EA275AE0=Heavily armoured yet mission-critical, Construction Yards are vital to Nod's war efforts and are therefore usually well defended. When necessary, they can be packed back into an MCV and redeployed to a more advantageous location. Construction Yards allow Nod structures to be built and deployed on the battlefield within their construction radius. Refineries and all Nod tech structures expand this construction area. build Emissaries and unpack into Outposts to further extend the construction radius.
Param/Value/F09096C1=The Dominion floods the outer colonies with propaganda. Destroying these signs of Dominion power will incite the people to rebellion.
